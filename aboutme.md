subtitle: Aspiring Full Stack Developer
---

My name is Jimwel, and I am an aspiring full stack developer.

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.
Before moving to Oregon, I grew up on a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean called Oahu.

During my four years studying computer science at Oregon State, I gained technical knowledge and experience in various areas
of computer science including Cyber Security, Mobile Development, and Web Development. Furthermore, I was a teaching assistant for the Introduction to Computer Science class. And Recently, I was fortunate enough to complete a software engineering internship at Mentor Graphics. 

Here are some companies I worked at in the past:

**Important Note:** The only thing that a forensic investigator is resonsible for is providing information on what happened on the system. He/She is NOT responsible for judging whether a person is guilty or not. 

## Type of cases investigated using computer forensics
There are different types of cases. But, the major types of cases include:
- Fraud
- Intellectual property threat
- Intrusions by a hacker
- Data breaches
- Inappropriate use of the internet (e.g Dark Web)
- Child Exploitation

### How is it all done? 
There are three general steps in foresnsic investigation:
1. Evidence aquisition
2. Investigation and analysis
3. Reporting results

Forensic computing can be classified into three different categories:
- Live forensics: Investigator must examine a machine that currently running due to volatile information.
- Post-mortem based forensics (memory/disk): This includes XBOX, Playstation, etc. since communication between users is capable. 
- Network based forensics

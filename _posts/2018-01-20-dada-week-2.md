## What is a forensic investigator?
A forensic investigator is responsible for retrieving information and data from computers and other devices to analyze facts about a case. Typically, forensic investigators work for law enforcement and private firms.

**Important Note:** The only thing that a forensic investigator is resonsible for is providing information on what happened on the system. He/She is NOT responsible for judging whether a person is guilty or not. 

## Type of cases investigated using computer forensics
There are different types of cases. But, the major types of cases include:
- Fraud
- Intellectual property threat
- Intrusions by a hacker
- Data breaches
- Inappropriate use of the internet (e.g Dark Web)
- Child Exploitation

### How is it all done? 
There are three general steps in foresnsic investigation:
1. Evidence aquisition
2. Investigation and analysis
3. Reporting results

Forensic computing can be classified into three different categories:
- Live forensics: Investigator must examine a machine that currently running due to volatile information.
- Post-mortem based forensics (memory/disk): This includes XBOX, Playstation, etc. since communication between users is capable. 
- Network based forensics

**Note:** It is very important to minimize data loss, record everything you've encountered, analyze all data collected that will be used as evidence, and report all your findings. Reports must be clearly written with proper language used. Sometimes reports must be verified by an attorney before submitting.

## Evidence
There are different layers where evidence can be found in computer forensics.
- Network
- Operating System (Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.). Common Operating Systems vary by location.
- Databases and application. Database forensics is booming as there are currently a limited number of people in this area.
- Peripherals
- Removable media
- Human Testimony

Hard disks can be hard to investigate as the average storage capacity of today is very large (1TB). Sometimes, criminals use harder drives with a storage capactiy of 8TB - 10TB of memory. 

Privacy is still something that investigators need to take into consideration. If there is information that investigators need to access that could potentially be an invasion of privacy, a judge must give them permission or a warrant to continue.

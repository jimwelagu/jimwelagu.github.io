## Why do we need network security? 
First of all, there are threats originating from the network. For example, a distributed denial of service. This term might be familiar with you, but if not, it’s an attack that floods a network with data packets causing a machine to crash. Another example are botnets, which are simply a network of malicious computers trying to perform a certain task. 

## Robustness Principle 
There was some guy named Jonathan Postel who had an idea:
>Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send

In other words, you should assume that the network is dangerous and filled with malicious entities that will cause harm.

## Network-Based Protection Strategies

### Positive policy 
This is also called white listing. This gives the defender the advantage. Let’s imagine you have a web server, and you as the defender is the only person knows what type of server it is. You can use this knowledge by catching the attacker. If the attacker tries to send mail to a web server, you know there’s an attack because you know that the web server isn’t suppose to be receiving or send mail. You as the defender know how your network behaves which means that you are reducing the amount of attacks to a finite set. On the other hand, if you’re thinking about every possible attack scenario, that’s an infinite set which is hard to defend.

### Firewall
A device that applies a policy. The way it works is there are devices that are split between zones. Once the zones have been made, you can define what protocols and interactions can be made between the zones.

Other firewall like devices include web gateway and email gateway. 

### Defense in Depth Principle
It is basically layers of security. If an attacker get through one layer, then he/she will need to get through another layer.	 

### Intrusion Detection
Intrusion detection systems are looking for things the defender does not want to happen. In comparison to firewalls, it is looking for things you do want to have happen. It is useful for catching known attacks and obtaining information on attacks.

### Honeynets / Intrusion Deception
The idea is to catch attacks in a phony network or catching the files in the honey. The defender will build a network decoy to deceive the attacker. It is important to not allow the decoy to interfere with the legit network.

### Quarantine
Put all infected hosts in an area where it can’t infect anyone else.

### Reputation
If someone has a good reputation, you tend to believe what they say. It is used for cloud services handling big data.

## Network Threats

### Man in the Middle
An attacker is in the middle of a network communication. During the communication between the two clients, the attacker is intercepting the messages and possibly changing the messages. Some black hat uses (BAD) for this attack are ARP poisoning and TCP hijacking. GOOD uses for man in the middle are terminating TCP Proxy, HTTP Proxy, Mail Proxy, and SSL.

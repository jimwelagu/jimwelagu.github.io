## Terminolgy
Before we begin with discussing messaging security, let’s define some terminology that you will need to know when reading this post.

**Spam/Ham** – It is a type of message that are advertising a product but comes in bulk (A large number of messages). Most of the time, these mail are scams and just want your money.

**Spamtrap/Honeypot** – It is an unsecured machine that will receive all spam messages without any blocking. This can help with research.

**Botnet** – A list of private malicious machines controlled as a group.

**Snowshoe spam** – A spam technique to avoid detection by using many different IP addresses.

## History of Spam
**419 Phishing:** This phishing attack is also called the advance-fee scam. The scam will request the user pay an up-front fee to obtain a larger amount of money in the future. This is GENIUS!

**Canadian Pharmacy Spam:** A spam that will flood networks with male-enhancement drugs and pain killers.

**Pump and Dump:** This is a type of fraud that will inflate the price of an own stock to influence the user to buy a stock at a higher price.

## Research Techniques
**Parse:** Extract meta data of messages including source IP address, subject, mail from, HELO, etc.

**Grouping:** Group messages by timestamp, source IP address or cidr, subject, URL, other comment elements. This gives you a research path. How do I get from receiving thousands of email to blocking the spam.

**Aggregation:** Check the amount of times the message is flagged for spam. Why is this happening? Why is it being flagged, and others are not?

You also need to consider how much human input is required? If there are lots of human input required, then it is not scalable. What if we do a fully automated research? That means that there will be some fault tolerance/resiliency which is not good. There needs to be a combination of automation and human input. 

## The Data Scientific Method
You’re probably wondering how to make a model based on the metadata of a message. Once you come up with the data and intuitions about the data, you will be able to create conclusions whether a message is a spam or not.

Below is an excerpt from the book “Data Driven By DJ Pail and Hilary Mason”. It gives you the scientific method based on data science. 


>1.	Start with the data.
>2.	Develop intuitions about the data and the questions it can answer.
>3.	Formulate your question.
>4.	Leverage your current data to better understand if it is the right question to ask. If not, iterate until you have a testable hypothesis.
>5.	Create a framework where you can run tests/experiments.
>6.	Analyze the results to draw insights about the questions.

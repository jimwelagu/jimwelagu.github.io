## Timeline of a malicious software
**First Contact**: Malware tries makes it's first contact through means of email, instant messaging, malvertising, poisoned search results, watering hole, physical access, etc. 

**Local Execution**: Once the attackers reach the target, the malware will start to execute code. Exploitation is the most popular type of code execution today.

**Establish Presence**: Malwares will start to establish presence by appearing legitimate to blend in and hide within the system. Bootkit and rootkits are sometimes used to tell your system to execute the code. Persistance is also seen malware where rebooting the system will not remove the malware. 

**Malicious Activity**: The ultimate goal for most malware is to harvest information such as enumarating documents, passwords, email addresses, keystokes, etc.

## Layers of Malware Defense
First layer of defense would include your network firewall and network intrusion prevention. 
Second layer of defense would include message reputation, network reputation, and web reputation.
Third layer of defense is the host firewall.
Between the third layer and fourth layer, there is a host intrusion prevention system.
Last layer of defense is access control and anti-malware software.

Information is gathered from all layers and transferred to a central intelligience unit to get a better hollistic view of the attack. This is to prevent problems when using different competitor software for different layers. Another reason to do this is to give the client a forensic view of what happened during the attack, what information was stolen? what files has been modified? etc.

## Hacking a system or software
When trying to find vulnerabilities in a system or software application, you're trying to think outside the box and understand what the developer of the system/software didn't think about. This is what **hacking** is all about, to manipulate software. 

There are two general way to manipulate software:
1. Find a vulnerability in the software and take advantage of it.
2. Exploit configuration vulnerabilities like weak passwords.

Now that hacking is a big thing involving governments of nations, it is very important to be ethical when attempting.
However, most companies will pay for reporting vulnerabilities. 

## Writing Exploits
{: .box-note}
**Note:** Writing exploits is NOT finding vulnerabilities. It is writing code to take advantage of the vulnerabilities that will lead to an exploit.

## Vulnerability: Memory Corruption
The high level definition of memory corruption is undefined behavior when trying to access memory in an invalid way.
- Accessing could be reading or writing
- Memory usually from heap or stack
- Memory corruption is typically unintended
- The undefined behavior is what we could use to take advantage of

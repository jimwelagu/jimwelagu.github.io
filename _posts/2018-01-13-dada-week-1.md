## Why do Malware exist?
As you might already know, malware is best described as any piece of malicious software that could potentially damage one's machine.
So, what is the reason behind creating malware? Why can't we just browse the internet in peace?
The typical answer people will think of is weaponization.
Yes, malware can be used as a dangerous weapon to harm users electronically.
But, it isn't the main reason it's out there.
The most signifcant reason for malware is for research purposes.
A prime example involves a graduate student from MIT named Robert Morris.
Morris wrote a worm aka "Morris worm" solely to highlight security vulnerabilities in systems.
However, the Morris worm resulted in damaging machines ultimately making them unusable. 

### Types of Malware

{: .box-warning}
**Virus**: Malicious software that is usually attached to an executable. Once executed by the user, the virus will replicate itself and spread to other computers.

{: .box-warning}
**Trojans**: A piece of malicious software that has a legitimate appearance. It's designed to "look" legit to trick user's into downloading and running the software. Trojans will usually create backdoors within the system to allow access for the attacker.

{: .box-warning}
**Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP)**: Any software that maybe unwanted by the user. Typically, users will unknowingly consent on downloading such programs. PUP include adware, spyware, tools, etc.

## How do Malware propogate?
The biggest infection vector is the **user**!
The user must be aware of what he/she is installing and running on their machine.
Adware is one of the major methods that attackers use to trick the user into downloading harmful software.
One solution is to be aware of what you're looking at. If it's too good to be true, then it's probably not real.
Another useful solution is using web browsing add-ons that will block ads from displaying such as AdBlock.

Other infection vectors include:
- USB Sticks (e.g [Stuxnet](https://www.bbc.com/timelines/zc6fbk7))
- Mobile App Stores (e.g [Google Play Fake Apps](https://blog.avast.com/fake-apps-on-google-other-weekly-news))
- Drive-by downloads
- PDF
- Office files

## Today's Malware Threats
As new technology trends change, new types of malware are being discovered.

Today's biggest threats include:
- Boot-kits
- Trojan Horse
- Spyware
- Exploit kits
- Bots
- Backdoors/RAT
- Ransome-ware

### Boot-kits
Bootkits attack the a section in the machine's physical motherboard. 
This specific portion of the motherboard is called the Master Boot Record. 
This allows the virus to execute malicious software on before the operating system boots.

### Trojan Horse
Trojan horses will trick users into downloading them as they will appear as legitimate software.
Once the user installs the torjan horse, it can cause great damage to the machine.
Typically, trojan horses will create backdoors in the user's system for the attacker to access.

### Spyware
Spyware is a program that is meant to collect personal information without the user's permission. There are four types of spyware software:
- Adware (Used by advertisers to display pop-up ads based on the user's browsing history)
- Stealware and Affiliate Frauds
- Identity Theft and Fraud
- Tracking Cookies
- Keyboard Logger

Note: Web browser add-ons such as Ghostery prevents advertisers and other services from collecting browsing data and browsing behaviors.

### Exploit kits
First, an exploit is a command or a piece of code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities in a system. Exploits will cause systems to behave unexpectedly. An exploit kit is basically a program or respository for managing and collecting different exploits.

### Remote Access Trojan
This type of malware will allow the attacker to have remote access to the victim's computer.
It is a trojan type of malware since it is typically installed on a computer without the user's knoweldge.

### Ransome-ware
Ransomware will encrypt all of the user's files and prevent access until the user pays some fee.
The fee is usually payed with cryptocurrency. One of the biggest ransomeware attacks was the WannaCry attack.

## Malware Naming Convention
1. Type: 
2. Platform/ 
3. Family
4. .Variant
5. !Information

{: .box-error}
**Example**: W32/Sdbot.worm (Platform: W32, Family: Sdbot, Variant: Worm)

{: .box-error}
**Example**: Trojan:Reveton.6 (Type: Trojan, Family: Reveton, Variant: 6)

## How do researchers or experts measure malware replication?
1. Researchers and experts try to determine what changes or events are occurring when the malware is replicating. Snapshots are taken before and after the malware is executed to analyze the changes.
2. Determine what did the malware actually do to the system with fake data compared to background noise.
3. Finally, they will analyze how significant the impact was on the system when the malware was executed. Was the impact small or big? Did the malware corrupt any personal data on the system? etc.

## Advance Persistent Threats
In this day in age, as technology is growing, cyber warfare is growing as well. 
There are more cyber attacks and they are a lot more organized and advanced.
The United States Air-force called these advance threats as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). 
"Advanced" represent the fluency and technical knowledge the attacker has.
Most hackers today have very creative and high level techniques to bypass a secured system. 
"Persistent" represents the objective or goal of the attack. 
"Threat" represents the attacker's organization. 
Most hackers come from an organized group that well funded to carry out their mission.

These organized group of hackers include terrorists/activists, governments, organized crime groups, competitors, and malicious insiders. Some of the goals behind the mission often involves money, revence, ideology, and excitement. Finally, targets of these attacks include corporations, governments, defense contractors, or anyone really.

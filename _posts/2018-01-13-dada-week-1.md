## Why do Malware exist?
As you might already know, malware is best described as any piece of malicious software that could potentially damage one's machine.
So, what is the reason behind creating malware? Why can't we just browse the internet in peace?
The typical answer people will think of is weaponization.
Yes, malware can be used as a dangerous weapon to harm users electronically.
But, it isn't the main reason it's out there.
The most signifcant reason for malware is for research purposes.
A prime example involves a graduate student from MIT named Robert Morris.
Morris wrote a worm aka "Morris worm" solely to highlight security vulnerabilities in systems.
However, the Morris worm resulted in damaging machines ultimately making them unusable.
